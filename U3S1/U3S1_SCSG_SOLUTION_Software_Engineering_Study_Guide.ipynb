    "1. What is OOP?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.\n",
    "It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an object?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Objects are instances of classes created with specific data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class?\n",
    "```\n",
    "In a nutshell, classes are essentially user defined data types. Classes are where we create a blueprint for the structure of methods and attributes. Individual objects are instantiated, or created from this blueprint.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is inheritance?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. Put another way, parent classes extend attributes and behaviors to child classes. -> Inheritance supports reusability.\n",
    "Child classes automatically gain access to functionalities within their parent class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What does it mean to \"instantiate an object\"?\n",
    "```\n",
    "When an object is instantiated from the class, the data and methods are encapsulated in that object.\n",
    "You are essentially creating a unique instance of the class.\n",
    "-> Like each day is a unique instance of earths habitual rotation about its axis...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is a dunder method (aka magic method)? What dunder method is called when you instantiate an object?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These are commonly used for operator overloading.\n",
    "The __init__ method for initialization is invoked without any call, when an instance of a class is created.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the super method and when is it used?\n",
    "```\n",
    "The super() function in Python makes class inheritance more manageable and extensible. The function returns a temporary object that allows reference to a parent class by the keyword super.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are two other programming paradigms?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.\n",
    "Declarative: Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.\n",
    "Structured: Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.\n",
    "Procedural: Imperative programming with procedure calls.\n",
    "Functional (Applicative): Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.\n",
    "Function-Level (Combinator): Programming with no variables at all.\n",
    "Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces. Object orientation can be:\n",
    "Class-based: Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.\n",
    "Prototype-based: Objects get behavior from a prototype object.\n",
    "Event-Driven: Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.\n",
    "Flow-Driven: Programming processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.\n",
    "Logic (Rule-based): Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.\n",
    "Constraint: Programming by specifying a set of constraints. An engine finds the values that meet the constraints.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
